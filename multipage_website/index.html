Gymnastics is a sport that many people of all genders do all over the world. There are many types of gymnastics such as tubling, rythamic, artistic, men's and many more but we're going to focus on women's artistic gymnastic. I do gymnastics and I love everything about it! I love my teammates and I love competing and getting my new high scores. Gymnastics has pros and cons for a lot of people just like any sport would but it's a really fun thing to even just try!

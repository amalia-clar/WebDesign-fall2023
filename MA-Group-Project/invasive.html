        <center><h2>What are Invasive Species?</h2>
        <p>Invasive species are animals that do not originate or belong in a habitat or area being 
            <br> not native but have gotten there anyways and are causing harm to their new environment.

    <div class="main02">
        <center><h2>How do they harm the environment?</h2>
        <p>Invasive species are throwing an ecosystem out of balance and causing mass destruction 
            <br> which can cause the extinction of native animals and lower natural resources. Besides 
            <br> ruining the environment, they also cause impacts on humans, like huge negative economic 
            <br> impacts and disruptions of human frequented places like beaches or trails.

        <center><h2>What can you do?</h2>
        <p>On an individual level you could not transport different wild animals, plants, and other
            <br> organisms around, whether it be through airplanes, cars, or just walking. You should also
            <br> not release animals like pets which are not native to the environment as they can cause huge
            <br> damage and start a population there. You could also donate to organizations dedicated to this cause.

    <div class="main05">
        <center><h2>What can the community do?</h2>
        <p>On a group level there could be more efforts to not only stop the progress of Invasive 
            <br>species but to also get them. A community could make organized efforts to cut down invasive plants
            <br> or with proper precautions help with capturing and/or moving animals back to their proper habitat.

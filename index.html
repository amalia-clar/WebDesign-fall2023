            <p> My name is Amalia. I live in Seattle which I love because there is so much to do. I 
                have a younger sister named Ava and I love doing anything with her. My family and I 
                like to cook and bake together so we always try making something new. I love doing 
                gymnstics and I am in a program called XCEL where I compete in a level called gold. 
                There are five levels and gold is the third one. I enjoy hanging out with my friends 
                and shopping is one of my favorite things to do with them. I love listening to music 
                during my freetime, Taylor Swift is my favorite artist so I listen to her the most.</p>
